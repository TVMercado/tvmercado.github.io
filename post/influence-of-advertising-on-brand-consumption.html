Additionally, advertising can also influence people to become loyal to certain brands. This occurs because people tend to identify with brands they admire. Additionally, advertising can also influence people to become more inclined to buy products from brands they know and appreciate.</p><p> However, advertising is not the only influence on brand consumption. Other factors, such as product quality and customer experience, also play an important role.

In this sense, advertising can be more effective in strengthening the relationship between the brand and the consumer.</p><h2> How Companies Could Leverage the Influence of Advertising</h2><p> Companies can take advantage of the influence of advertising in various ways. First, they must focus on creating a consistent and cohesive advertising strategy that aligns with the needs and objectives of the brand. Additionally, companies should also focus on creating a good consumer experience, ensuring that consumers have a positive impression of the brand. This can occur through sustainable and responsible marketing practices.</p><h4> How can companies measure the effect of advertising on brand consumption?</h4><p> Companies can measure the effect of advertising on brand consumption through monitoring the results of the advertising campaign. This can be done using indicators such as conversion rate, return on investment (ROI), and marketing sensitivity. Additionally, companies can also use data analysis techniques to better understand consumer behavior and improve their marketing strategy.</p><p> In summary, advertising is an essential element of any company's marketing strategy.

Companies must focus on creating a coherent and consistent advertising strategy that adapts to the needs and objectives of the brand, and also focus on creating a good consumer experience.
